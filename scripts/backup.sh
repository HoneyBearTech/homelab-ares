# Back up the stack's state: every service's data mounts (each read-write volume or directory it mounts, such as
# Nginx Proxy Manager's configuration and certificates or Uptime Kuma's database; never the Docker socket) and the
# settings files. Each service is stopped only while its own archives are written, so its database is consistent,
# and started again afterwards if it was running; services with nothing to archive keep running.
#
#   scripts/backup.sh [DIR]      DIR defaults to backups/<date>-<time> in the checkout (gitignored)
#
# DIR gets one <service>--<path>.tar.gz per mount, the settings (.env and any <service>.env) under env/, a MANIFEST
# naming each archive's service, container path, source and image, and SHA256SUMS, all readable only by the user
# who ran it: the archives hold logins, tokens and private keys. Copy it off the host. Restore with
# scripts/restore.sh. It runs `docker compose` from the checkout, so the standard Compose variables
# (COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME, COMPOSE_FILE, COMPOSE_ENV_FILES) select another project, as the smoke test does.
